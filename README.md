The problem boils down to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability, a widely used plugin in WordPress templates, Revolution Slider (revslider). This is a serious problem, which allows the attacker access to system files without any restrictions, for example the file / etc / passwd or the WordPress wp-config.php file, which has the authentication data with the system data base.
